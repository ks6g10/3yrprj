\section{Introduction}
The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference. IFAAMAS
seeks to give these conference by-products a uniform, high-quality
appearance.  To do this, IFAAMAS follows the rigid requirements that
ACM has for the format of the proceedings documents: there is a
specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified set of
fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in certain specified
sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy), a specified live area
(18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on the page,
specified size of margins (2.54cm [1"] top and bottom and 1.9cm
[.75"] left and right; specified column width (8.45cm [3.33"]) and
gutter size (.083cm [.33"]).

The good news is, with only a handful of manual
settings\footnote{Two of these, the {\texttt{\char'134 numberofauthors}}
and {\texttt{\char'134 alignauthor}} commands, you have
already used; another, {\texttt{\char'134 balancecolumns}}, will
be used in your very last run of \LaTeX\ to ensure
balanced column heights on the last page.}, the \LaTeX\ document
class file handles all of this for you.

The remainder of this document is concerned with showing, in
the context of an ``actual'' document, the \LaTeX\ commands
specifically available for denoting the structure of a
proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions
or explanations of such commands.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Coalition formation}


\subsection{The {\secit DP} Algorithm} 
The DP algorithm as shown in algorithm \ref{DP} works by producing two output tables, $O$ and $f$, 
where each table have one entry per coalition structure. 
An entry in $f$ represent a value a certain coalition structure is given, 
while $O$ represent which splitting, if any, maximised the coalition structure for the entry in $f$ which it represent.
More elaborated, given all coalitions of agents $A$, $C\subseteq A$, for each coalition in $C$, evaluate all
pairwise disjoint subsets named splittings on their pairwise collective sum against the coalitions
original value. Given one splitting is greater, update the value of the coalition $f(C) := f(C') + f(C\setminus C')$
and assign $O$ on $C$ to represent the new splitting, $O(C) := \{C',C''\}$. These steps are first carried out
on all coalition structures with two agents, continuing until $N$ agents. 
This means, given a coalition structure $S$ with cardinality $|S| = n$, then all coalition structures
for the sizes 1,2,...,n-1 have already been evaluated. Given 
As described later in section ?? the part of the algorithm that is parallilsed is the max function on line \ref{lst:line:a}
which handles the evaluation of all splittings of a given coalition structure.

The table $O$ may be discarded to reduce the memory requirement by half removing instant access to the splittings,
the valid splittings is easily retrived however as outlined in algorithm \ref{idpref}. Essentialy, all coalitions in $C \in CS^*$ which value in $f$
is not equal to the initial bid in $b$, find the first splitting that is equal to the value in $f$.
The overhead of this is insignificant as it needs to evaluate at most $n -1$ coalitions compared to the exponential
numbers of evaluations carried out \cite{eps265062}.

\begin{algorithm}

\subsection{The CUDA Architecture}
Graphics Processing Units(GPU) from Nvidia and AMD is highly multithreaded, many-core architectures primarily aimed at 
highly parallel image processing and rendering, however it have in the last years moved more towards supporting general purpose computing.
It does so by devoting a larger amount of transitors towards many computational units rather than data caching and advanced 
flow controll more often seen in CPU architectures.
Nvidia describes their general purpose GPU CUDA architecture as a Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT) architecture, 
meaning groups of multiple threads excecute the same instructions concurrently and is proportional to SIMD architectures. 
This enables their GPUs to be highly advantageous when performing data-independant and non-divergent tasks. 

To understand this further the grouping of the threads need to be explained.
A kernel which is a device specific CUDA function that is called by the sequential host code,
will request a specified number of blocks in a grid of blocks.
Each block may to this date consist of up to 1024 threads depending on the compatability of the card, with a maximum
grid size of $2^{31}-1$ blocks subjected to compatability. When run, the blocks will be distributed onto available multiprocessors,
which then independantly schedule the runtime of the block. Note that blocks may be excecuted concurrently or sequential depending on
the current workload and the number of available multiprocessors.
The block is split into smaller units of 32 threads called warps, all threads within the same warp are always scheduled
the same instruction to be run and this is what embodies the SIMT paradigm. 
Therefore, branching threads causing inter-warp divergence means a warp will have inactive threads not excecuting any instructions, 
which may lead to poor efficiency with worst case of sequential performance. Further, warps are scheduled independantly of eachother
meaning possible concurent excecution of warps.

The threads communicate with eachother through writes to various types of memory outlined in table \ref{mem}.
There are three types of thread writable memory in the architecture; registers and local memory are each threads
coupled memory which is not volatile and may be shared with other threads inside the same warp as described in section \ref{reduction}. 
Shared memory is by its name shared between all threads within the same block, as it may be written to by any thread within the block
it should be treated as volatile, thus syncronization inside the block have to be consider whilts dealing with shared memory.
Finally, global memory is the only persistant memory which will persist between each kernel call, it may be manipulated by the host,
but also by any thread, and is the only means of communication inbetween kernels, blocks, and the host.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Memory scope, lifetime, and speed \label{mem}}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
Type&Scope&Lifetime&Relative Speed \\ \hline
Register&Thread \& Warp&Thread&Fastest\\
Shared&Block&Block&Fast\\
Global&Kernel \& Host&Program&Slow\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Model and Cuda Implementation}
Given the three entities of data that is needed to be represented for each coalition structure; 
the coalition structure itself, its value and the most beneficial splitting. 
Memory constraints will be imposed given a large amount of agents as a result 
of its exponential growth of coalition structures. In order to minimize memory usage
several technices were imposed. Firstly, given N agents, the number of values for each coalition
structure possible is $2^{|N|}$, which was represented as a simple value array.
The coalition structure itself may be represented as an integer where the n'th 
agent of the coalition structure is represented by setting the n'th bit in an binary integer. 
Given four agents $A = {f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4}$, coalition $C = {f_1,f_3,f_4}$ would be represented
as $C = 1101$ in the binary system and $11$ in the decimal system. Therefore, if the coalition
structure is represented as an integer it can implicitly be stored as an index 
to its coalition value and most beneficial splitting.




\subsubsection{Coalition Structure Splittings}

Binary&0001\hfill 1100&0100\hfill 1001&1000\hfill 0101 \\

\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Splittings as mentioned are pairwise disjoint subsets of a coalition structure, 
given the coalition structure $C = \{f_1,f_3,f_4\}$ the splittings
are shown in table \ref{split}. In order to generate the splitting there is essentially two methods used, 
the, initShift, initialSplit and nextSplit methods. 
The function initShift as detailed in algorithm \ref{initshift} is necessary to setup the environment for 
all calls to initialSplit, what it does is using the bit operation $find first set$ to find the indexes of all bits set
in from the integer coalition input. This will give each entry in the $shift$ array an unique number. 
This unique numbers will be used by initialSplit to distribute the bits of the count to fit the configurations bits.
It does so by taking a count as input representing which n'th splitting should be created, finds the index of its 
set bits, and finaly left shifts each bit with the value in the shift array its index reference to.

nextSplit works through a recurence relation which means in order to have 
concurent threads independant of eachother, an initial splitting for each thread have to be calculated using initialSplit. 
initialSplit works by first genereting an packed index array of which bits are set in the coalition structure using initShift.
Given which n'th splitting it should generate, it distributes the bits of $n$ to the corresponding bits of coalition $C$. 
Thereafter nextSplit will be used to generate the next splitting.

\subsubsection{Reduction} \label{reduction}
As the evaluation of each coalition structure is to find the splitting 
of the coalition structure which maximises the value of the coalition structure,
it is simply needed to compare the values of all splittings with eachother to find the most valued one. 

The reduction is done on four levels of scope as seen on lines ?? to ?? in algorithm ??. On thread level, 
each thread evaluate a number of splittings to determine their most valued splitting,
then all threads inside the same warp concurrently exchange their largest register values to find the most valued splitting among the warp.
This is done by utilizing a function called $\_\_shfl\_xor$ which allows for an exchange of register values between threads within the same warp,
allowing for a substantial reduction in shared memory use. 
On thread block level, the threads are split up into two groups, active and inactive threads. 
The active threads will compare its value against a corresponding inactive thread, then half the number of active thread.
Iterate until the maximum value have converged into one single thread holding the maximum value for the whole thread block.
Finally, the single thread will attempt to update the global memory using atomic functions 
given that the value of the coalition in table $f$  is less.


We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
the command \texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the
command \texttt{{\char'134}textbf}
and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
\texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do not
have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
Let's make this a rather short one to
see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
document class file. Take care with the use
of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
the beginning and end of
the text that is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
you can find a complete list of what is
available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
User's Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\subsection{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning,
clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or
books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed or supported.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.ps}, \textbf{.eps} and \textbf{.pdf} files to be displayable with \LaTeX. Note that if you are using \textbf{pdflatex} to typeset your paper, you may only include \textbf{.pdf}, \textbf{.png}, \textbf{.jpeg} and \textbf{.gif} files in your paper. If, instead, you choose to use \textbf{latex} and \textbf{dvipdf} to typeset your paper, you may only include \textbf{.ps}, \textbf{.eps} files. More details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
%\includegraphics{fly.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=height=1in, width=1in]{fly}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic that has been resized with the \texttt{{\char'134}includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
\begin{figure*}
\centering
%\includegraphics{flies}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!

%Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
%used; use
%the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
%commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{rosette}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic that has

%\vskip -6pt
\end{figure}

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.

\section{Acknowledgments}
This section is optional; it is a location for you
to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
document in Appendix-appropriate form:
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
\subsubsection{Math Equations}
\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\paragraph{Display Equations}
\subsubsection{Citations}
\subsubsection{Tables}
\subsubsection{Figures}
\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
\subsection{Conclusions}
\subsection{Acknowledgments}
\subsection{Additional Authors}
This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
You just add the names and information in the
\texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
of the document.
\subsection{References}
Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
the .tex source file and comment out
the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
% This next section command marks the start of
% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
\section{More Help for the Hardy}
The aamas2012 .cls file is based on the
sig-alternate.cls file that is itself chock-full of succinct and
helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately experienced
to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading it useful but please
remember not to change it.
